  publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

  # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
  # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
  # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
  # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
  # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
  # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
  # Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
  # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
  # Read more about iOS versioning at
  # https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
  # In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
  # of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
      - assets/images/onboarding/
      - assets/images/login/
      - assets/images/home/
      - assets/images/deposit/

      - assets/icons/sign_up/
      - assets/icons/verify_email/
      - assets/icons/home/
      - assets/icons/deposit/
      - assets/icons/withdrawal/
      - assets/icons/balance_history/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
      - family: Inter
        # fonts:
        #   - asset: assets/fonts/Inter.ttf
        #     weight: 400
        #   - asset: assets/fonts/Inter.ttf
        #     weight: 500
        #   - asset: assets/fonts/Inter.ttf
        #     weight: 600
        #   - asset: assets/fonts/Inter.ttf
        #     weight: 700
      - family: Poppins
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
            weight: 700
